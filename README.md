#Ideas for Additional Analysis: 
       
       * can combine all the data across the worksheets to create a single dashboard that shows the unique tickers, their yearly change          and percentage change. Then can create a scatterplot to see the distribution and compare the stock tickers with each other. 
       * categorize each stock according to its industry then perform market research on the macro/micro economic events happened during          the year that affected the stock performances.
